<!-- U- [x] Scaffold the Project
	Created CUDA project structure with mandelbrot_cuda.cu, README.md, build.bat, and run.bat filesile to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->
- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	CUDA test program for Windows that moves data to VRAM, performs GPU computation, and generates visual results - specifically a Mandelbrot set visualization

- [ ] Scaffold the Project
	<!--
	Ensure that the previous step has been marked as completed.
	Call project setup tool with projectType parameter.
	Run scaffolding command to create project files and folders.
	Use '.' as the working directory.
	If no appropriate projectType is available, search documentation using available tools.
	Otherwise, create the project structure manually using available file creation tools.
	-->

- [x] Customize the Project
	Created comprehensive CUDA Mandelbrot visualization with GPU memory management, performance monitoring, and visual output

- [x] Install Required Extensions
	No extensions needed for this CUDA project

- [x] Compile the Project
	Successfully compiled CUDA Mandelbrot program - hello_cuda.exe and mandelbrot_cuda_clean.exe generated

- [ ] Create and Run Task
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Check https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks to determine if the project needs a task. If so, use the create_and_run_task to create and launch a task based on package.json, README.md, and project structure.
	Skip this step otherwise.
	 -->

- [ ] Launch the Project
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Prompt user for debug mode, launch only if confirmed.
	 -->

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed.
	Verify that README.md and the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists and contains current project information.
	Clean up the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory by removing all HTML comments.
